# Credit_Scoring_Model
a simple ai model that predicts credit score of individuals
Credit Scoring Model ‚Äì Classification Based
This project focuses on developing a credit scoring model using classification algorithms to predict creditworthiness. It was completed as part of an internship assignment on May 16, 2025.

üìå Objective
To build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer is creditworthy based on their financial and personal data. This model aids in assessing loan eligibility or financial risk.

‚úÖ Task Completed
