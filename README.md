# Credit_Scoring_Model
a simple ai model that predicts credit score of individuals
Credit Scoring Model – Classification Based
This project focuses on developing a credit scoring model using classification algorithms to predict creditworthiness. It was completed as part of an internship assignment on May 16, 2025.

📌 Objective
To build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer is creditworthy based on their financial and personal data. This model aids in assessing loan eligibility or financial risk.

✅ Task Completed
Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values

Encoded categorical variables

Normalized numerical features

Model Development

Implemented classification algorithms:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Split data into training and testing sets

Model Evaluation

Used accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

Compared performance of different classifiers

Result

Identified the best performing model based on evaluation metrics

Visualized results using confusion matrix and ROC curve
